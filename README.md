A motor memory, text-to-speech AAC created with Sapper & Svelte.

This is designed to be installed to a device and run as a progressive web app.

Being new to Svelte, I wanted to try out Sapper. Does this application need a platform like Sapper to be successful? No, it would be just fine with standalone Svelte.
